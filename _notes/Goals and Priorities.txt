4F03 Final Project:



Goals:
1. Get working in open acc
2. Autonomous Pathing of cube
3. Make 4 min video


Stretch Goals:
1. “make video” (automatic)
2. open MPI


Bonuses:
(3%) If your perform all floating-point computations in single precision, which should be faster than the present double precision computation.
(7%) If you parallelize using MPI and OpenACC together. Then you can render on more then one server at the same time. Submit a description of how you have done it.
(20%) If your computation navigates automatically through the objects.
